        <h1>Write Your New York Essay</h1>
        <h3>Union Square</h3>
       <p>My city starts in a square.
    My city starts in Union Square, to be more specific. It's just a small neighborhood surrounding a tiny park to most people. Until about three years ago, it was just a small neighborhood surrounding a tiny park to me as well. Until about three years ago, I didn't care about it at all and only ever went there when I was little to have sleepovers with my friend, Emily, who lives in the area. Three years ago, though, is when my city would start to mold around this small neighborhood as I spent more and more time in Union Square.
    It wasn't my idea to go there. My friends would start to hangout there and meet up after our zoom classes would end in freshman year. If I'd had it my way, I would have just had everyone come to my neighborhood and stay close to my building. However, my friend Emily beat me to it and would always insist that we meet at her house instead, because she claimed it was the easiest option. Originally, I would bail every single time we made plans. I didn’t care about Union Square, I thought it was boring and dull and a waste of my time. But, being thirteen years old and living through a pandemic with only your sister as company can make a girl a bit desperate, so eventually I, too, would start to go out to Union Square to see everyone.
    Slowly, I started to warm up to Union as I went there more and more with my friends. Every time we walked through Barnes & Noble or sat on a bench in the park to eat Starbucks, I found that the neighborhood seemed more vibrant, more open to me. Now, my friends and I walk all around the place in circles, back and forth and back again, going in and out of all of our favorite stores just to look at the same clothes we saw the day before. It’s in these moments that I actually have the most fun, that I can relax and be free and just do things because I feel like it, and feel ok because my friends are doing the same things I am. My city has been shaped around this place because it’s the where my friends are, it’s where we can all spend time together and just laugh and do whatever we want.
        My city changes when my friends aren't with me. When I get off the bus at 14th street by myself, I find the day just as gray as it was when I woke up. The streets are endless and bumpy and the buildings loom over me.  When I'm by myself, Union Square looks more like it came out of a Batman movie than the colorful and lively place I see when I have company. Nobody is next to me laughing, and any store I might want to go to is much too far. I count down the steps until I reach the bus stop because there is nothing that is keeping me there, nothing that makes me not want to be home already. Union Square without those people that I care about is just another place in New York, a pit stop for me to get home from.
        I see the same thing happening with other New Yorkers, too. Even when I'm not in Union Square, the coldness of the city is reflected on the faces of everyone I walk past when they're alone. People glare and trudge their way through the streets in their rush to get to wherever they're going. When I walk past Madison or Washington Square, almost everyone there is in pairs or groups, laughing with their friends or loved ones. When I walk past a couple of people together, I don’t see any coldness on their faces because they’re already so interested in the person next to them. In every corner, I see people having fun in their surroundings because of the other people that they are with, while also seeing the indifference people have towards those same surroundings when there is nobody to share it with. I would never go to Lush or Brandy Melville by myself because the fun doesn’t come from smelling the soaps or buying a new tank top, it comes from showing my friends the weird bath bombs or us laughing at the weird jackets that just came in for the winter season.
        I know that people value alone time and everything, but in a place that is so focused on hustle and self preservation, can anyone even enjoy themselves here if there's nobody to distract them from the tension that fills the air? Why else would this concrete city be so populated, unless it had to be for it to seem bearable? If we had picked anywhere else to hangout those three years ago, I could be spending everyday in SoHo, Tribeca, Coney Island, it wouldn’t matter. Union Square would be as important to me as Far Rockaway is if the people I cared about didn’t spend time there.
    I think I”ve been to Far Rockaway like, once when I was seven.
