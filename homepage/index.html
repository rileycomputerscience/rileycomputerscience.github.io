        <p class = "h3">About me: Hi! My name is riley and I'm sixteen right now. I've been going to Nest since 2012 and I'll be graduating in 2024. I like to read when I have spare time from school, but if I'm feeling lazy I'll watch tv. I' ve never had any pets, which is not fair
        because my parents both had of a bunch of them when they were growing up.
        My favorite subject is ELA. I like history too, but not as much. I'm ok at science. I hate math though. Like, haaaaate it. In this website, I have three other pages, which show my Write Your New York essay, Union Square, and the Barnes and Noble store in Union Square.
