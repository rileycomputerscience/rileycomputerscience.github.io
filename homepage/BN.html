        <p>This is Barnes and Noble. The bookstore has several locations, but I always go to this one in union square. This store is actually one of the main reasons why I chose to write my essay on Union Square. I come here all the time and hang out here for hours with my friends. I think the last book I bought here was Frankenstein. We read it in school but I didn't really pay attention because it was homework so I bought it again to actually read it.</P>
